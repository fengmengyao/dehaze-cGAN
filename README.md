# dehaze-cGAN
Run in Torch7 platform.

I'm very appreciative of your attention. Because the trained models may be produce some different effects in varying platforms and computers, I strongly suggest that you can adopt our trained model when restoring real world haze images. If you repeate our works on other platforms (e.g. Pytorch), please referrencing https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix and finishing other changes.
